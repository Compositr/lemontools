ðŸ¥³ Woohoo! The version 2 update for Lemon Tools has officially dropped! This update completely redesigns the bot from the ground up, with every component being recoded to be better! Without further ado, lets get straight into the changes

# Complete Re-code

As mentioned above, Lemon Tools has been completely recoded. This should allow us to implement new features more quickly in the future. Furthermore, this recode has also made the bot more efficient, meaning it should become faster and quicker to respond.

The above is a graph showing how many resources (Memory) the Bot consumes before (at the blue line) and after (at the rightmost green line). This is just one of the many performance improvements that were made to Lemon Tools over the course of this recode.

If you are interested about what exactly we changed, check out our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/cooljim/lemontools) for the code.

# Redesigned Help Menu

Before the v2 update, we were getting complaints and feedback about our growing help menu. It was difficult to read and navigate, and gave little information about each command. We listened to your feedback, and in this update we present...

We think it's easier to navigate and leaves room for new commands as they get added. Furthermore, this redesign takes full advantage of Discord's new "message components", which are special things bots can add to messages to _spice up_ the user experience. In this help menu, for example we used a dropdown menu. In the following months, expect more cool components making their way into the bot.

# New Poll Command

We've also added a few new commands, one of which is `/poll`. This command simply creates a poll which users can vote on. See the image below:

# Redesigned Information Command

Along with the `/help` command, we've also redesigned the `/info` command. The command now shows architecture, node version and v8 version information in addition to a description about what the bot does.

# New Minecraft-related Commands

In this update, we've also added a new Minecraft related command (`/mcserver`), under the gaming category. We have also redesigned the old `/mcplayer` command to improve it's general look.

The new command, `/mcserver` allows you to check the status of any Minecraft Server, as long as it's broadcasting it's status. The command looks like this:

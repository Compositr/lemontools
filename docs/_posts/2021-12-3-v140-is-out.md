Version `v1.4.0` is now rolling out across Discord! Just in time for the holiday season, a new update with a ton of features has dropped! We will be covering the most significant features, fixes and additions in the article. See the [Changelog](/changelog) for the full details.

# New Commands

`v1.4.0` bring _6_ new commands. These are:

- `/pokemon`
- `/coin`
- `/timediff`
- `/snipe`
- `/invite`
- `/embed`

## Pokémon

The new `/pokemon` command lets you search the PokeAPI for a Pokémon.

## Coin

Such a simple command, although we forgot to implement it in the previous update. `/coin` is just a simple coin flipper. Nothing special here.

## Time Diff

`/timediff` is a useful command for those who deal with dates often - for example an event organiser. This command allows one to calculate the difference between two dates, in days, hours, minutes and seconds

## Snipe

Although we'll probably have to remove this command in the future when we get verified (Discord is very touchy with snipe and snipe-like commands.), `/snipe` is here for the time being. `/snipe` can be used to "undelete" deleted messages - when a user deletes a message, our bot stores that message. Then, when someone uses snipe, that message is recovered and sent by the bot.

Please note that this is not to be used as a tool for harassment. You _can_ get banned from the bot for using the `/snipe` command in a way which harms or harasses other Discord users.

# New Features

In this update, we've added the "Invite Row", which is a row of buttons that appear whenever a user uses any of the following commands:

- `/info`
- `/invite`
- `/help`

It looks something like this:

# Bug fixes + Various Patches

An updates isn't an update without bugfixes and patches! There were two bugs we were aware of, which were patched during this update. The first was reported by a user, whilst the other is a miscellaneous security issue which is not to be released to the public.

## `/dadjoke` and `/dog` Commands not Working

In this update, we resolved the issue of the `/dadjoke` and `/dog` commands not working. This issue was down to the bot trying to edit a reply which did not exist - the bot tried to delay the reply by sending the "Lemon Tools is thinking" message - but due to some poor coding, a race condition occurred, where the bot would attempt to edit the "delayed" reply before it was even sent out, resulting in an error.

## Internal `/eval` Command Changes

This probably won't concern the majority of you, but we've also changed how the internal `/eval` command looks.

## Category Changes

Lastly, we've moved around some of the commands to new categories, to try and clean up the `/help` command.

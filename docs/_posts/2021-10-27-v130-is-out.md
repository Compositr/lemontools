Great news everyone! Version `v1.3.0` is now out, and ready! This new update brings about a lot of new features, including giveaways, trivia quizzes, context menus and a whole lot more!

# Context Menus

Context Menus are here, with a test being rolled out to everyone in this update. If you haven't heard of Context Menus before, they're simply a thing that pops up when you right click certain elements of Discord. See the images below for some more information:

We think these context menus make it easier to interact with the bot, especially on mobile devices where typing may be not as efficient or accessible. We plan to add more context menu commands in the next update.

# Giveaways

In this update, we've also added giveaways to Lemon Tools!

To start a giveaway, you must use the `/giveaway` command, and provide a channel. Then the interactive giveaway creator will walk you through creating a giveaway.

A winner will automatically be chosen randomly from the participants, and it will be announced in the same channel the giveaway is. You can reroll or stop a giveaway by using a context menu (see above).

This is useful for online giveaways, or if you would like to giveaway something digital (e.g. Nitro or Crypto/Bitcoin).

# Trivia & Quiz

Furthermore, we have added the `/quiz` command which grabs a random question from the [Open Trivia Database](//opentdb.com). Try it in Discord to see it in action!

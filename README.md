# How to install

1. Download a copy of the source code. You should have NodeJS (v16.10.x +) installed on your machine, and a copy of npm (v7.x.x +) already installed.

2. Fill out an .env file. See .env.example for an example. Open your favourite text editor, and edit the config.json to your liking.

3. Open a terminal window in the directory where you have the code. Type these commands (this is for Windows, differs between OS)

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

Once that is done, run

```base
npm run start
```

The bot should start.

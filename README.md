# Lemon Tools

Lemon Tools is the premier multipurpose Discord bot for your server. Lemon Tools is fully open source, and trusted by many Discord servers. Our goal is to create a useful, and simple bot to cover all your bot and automation needs in a Discord server.

# Contribution Guidelines

We know everyone might not be able to code, but that doesn't mean you can't help with the development of Lemon Tools!

## If you don't know how to code

That's perfectly fine! If you have an idea, but don't know how to implement it, [create a discussion](https://github.com/Compositr/lemontools/discussions/new?category=ideas) detailing your idea.

Any idea is perfectly valid, and something that might seem useless or even silly to you might be very useful for someone else.

## If you can code in TypeScript

Awesome! Go ahead and fork this repo, and [check out](https://github.com/Compositr/lemontools/discussions/categories/ideas) some ideas the community has thought of, and have a crack at them.

When you're done, shoot us a [pull request](https://github.com/Compositr/lemontools/compare), and we'll get your code checked out and potentially merged! However, please limit individual pull requests to one idea/feature each for ease of management.

We don't have much documentation or wiki, but each file should have an `@fileoverview` JSDoc to give you idea of it's role in the bot.

## Bugs!

If you've found a bug, great job! It's best to head on over to our Discord support server [here](https://discord.gg/Xn3wcwHnZg), and open a support ticket. This is faster than opening an issue and will likely get your issue resolved quickly.

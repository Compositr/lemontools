# Changelog
List of changes for Lemon Tools since version `3.0.0`. See commit history for full changes; this changelog is only meant to be a short summary of features

## Structure
Each changelog entry is to be separated by **2 newlines**. Each entry is to start with a **h2** (`##`) title with the version number and name. For example:
```md


## 0.0.0 VersionName
```
A newline should also be present after the title. Then, there should be three headings: **new features**, **changes**, and **bug fixes**. These should be **h3** and be followed by an unordered list. Each section should be separated by **one** newline.
